# Holyarchers Wordpress Theme

A theme for holyarcher.com bloggers. Based off of _s.

I like to develop with OSX, via MAMP. And I used CodeKit for the SASS. This is how I link my theme in:

`ln -s ~/[theme-dir]/holyarchers /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/[wordpress-dir]/themes`

## Setup

1. Setup a primary nav

2. Install a bunch of plugins

  * Options Framework

  * Black Studio TinyMCE

3. Configure Widgets

2. Add social media links

## Extras

### Code Highlighting

This is done through prism. Check the basic usage here:
